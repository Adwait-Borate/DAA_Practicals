# 📦 Knapsack and Subset Sum Problems

This repository contains implementations of various knapsack problems and subset sum algorithms. Each implementation showcases different techniques, including recursive, dynamic programming (DP), and fractional approaches.

## 📂 Project Structure


## 📝 Descriptions

- **0-1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)**: A classic approach to solve the knapsack problem using DP.
- **0-1 Knapsack (Recursive)**: A straightforward recursive solution for the 0-1 knapsack problem.
- **Fractional Knapsack**: An implementation that allows for fractional parts of items to be taken.
- **Subset Sum**: Algorithms to determine subsets of a given set that sum to a specific target, including user input variations.
